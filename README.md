# About me

### I'm a biologist with an interest in microbiome research. I work a lot with DNA sequence data such as amplicon and shotgun metagenomic data. I have experience in statistical analyses in R, including multivariate and multilevel modelling. Currently learning about Bayesian stats and trying my hand at Python.
